# Advanced Analytics-Python 
Regression and Clustering Analysis on Health Insurance Data

# Context
Health insurance claims data was chosen for exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing using Python. The main findings of this project was presented in a [Tableau storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/HealthInsuranceClaims-Storyboard/HealthInsuranceClaims?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).https://public.tableau.com/views/HealthInsuranceClaims-Storyboard/HealthInsuranceClaims?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
In the storyboard you'll find the results of some of the exploratory results on the relationship between age and charges, and the clusters developed as a result of k-means clustering analysis. Not all of the exploratory results were presented, the additional results will be found in the folder. 

# Objectives
Find out if there are strong indicators that lead to higher insurance claims? 

# Sources
This data is most likely synthesized for learning purposes. This might not actually represent true patterns within health insurance claims across regions. The original version of this dataset is from a book called Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz. This dataset was pulled from a public domain and published on GitHub by Zach Stednick and [Kaggle by Miri Choi](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. 
Other sources used was the JSON file found in the folder and time series data from the [US Federal Reserve Data Releases](https://data.nasdaq.com/data/FED/FA583155005_Q-insurance-companies-and-pension-funds-prepayment-of-insurance-premiums-and-reserves-for-outstanding-claims-liability-ima-quarterly-transactions-sa)https://data.nasdaq.com/data/FED/FA583155005_Q-insurance-companies-and-pension-funds-prepayment-of-insurance-premiums-and-reserves-for-outstanding-claims-liability-ima-quarterly-transactions-sa
